# Experiments

`matbii` has been built to support experiments in multi-task attention research. The [main configuration](getting_started/configuration.md) provides a number of useful options that will help you set up an experiment. It also provides some useful functionality for analysis the results of your experiments, including logging of events, and various tools for parsing and working with these files to extract useful information.

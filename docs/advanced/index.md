The advanced guide presents some advanced topics and is experimental/a work in progress. Much of the guide will refer you to the `icua` documentation (which is a work in progress) as the `icua` package contains the relevant classes/APIs that enable deeper customisation. 

## [Custom Entry Points](./custom_entry_points.md)

The default entry points does lots, but you may want to use your own - especially if you have added some extra features! 

## [Custom Tasks](./custom_tasks.md)

Currently only three tasks are implemented in `matbii`, you may with to implement more tasks, the current task implementations should provide some inspiration, this guide will assist you in getting to know what is required using the current task as a running example. 

## [Custom Devices](./custom_devices.md)

`matbii` supports the usual periferal devices (mouse, keyboard) and also eyetracking. This guide will show you how to implement a new custom device - note that you will need a python binding/SDK to your device.

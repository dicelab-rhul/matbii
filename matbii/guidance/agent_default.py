            sensors (list[Sensor]): list of sensors, this will typically be a list of `icua.agent.TaskAcceptabilitySensor`s. A `UserInputSensor` will always be added automatically.
            actuators (list[Actuator]): list of actuators, this will typically contain actuators that are capable of providing visual feedback to a user, see e.g. `icua.agent.GuidanceActuator` and its concrete implementations. A `CounterFactualGuidanceActuator` will be added by default.
            break_ties (Literal["random", "longest", "since"], optional): how to break ties if guidance may be shown on multiple tasks simultaneously. Defaults to "random". "random" will randomly break the tie, "longest" will choose the task that has been in failure for the longest, "since" will choose the task that has not had guidance shown for the longest time.
            grace_mode (Literal["guidance_task", "guidance_any", "failure"], optional): how to track the grace period. "guidance_task" will track the time since guidance was last shown on the task, "guidance_any" will track the time since guidance was last shown on any task, "failure" will track the time since the last failure on the task. Defaults to "failure".
            attention_mode (Literal["fixation", "gaze", "mouse"], optional): method of determining where the user is attending. "fixation" will use the most recent gaze fixation, "gaze" will use the gaze position (including saccades), "mouse" will use the current mouse position. Defaults to "fixation".
            grace_period (float, optional): the time to wait (seconds) before guidance may be shown for a task after the last time guidance was shown on the task. Defaults to 3.0 seconds.
            counter_factual (bool, optional): whether guidance should be shown to the user, or whether it should just be logged.  This allows counter-factual experiments to be run, we can track when guidance would have been shown, and compare the when it was actually shown (in a different run). Defaults to False.
